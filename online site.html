  <h1>Why Egypt Should Avoid Attacking Israel</h1>
  <p>A Reasoned Argument for Peace and Stability</p>
</header>

<div class="slide" id="slide1">
  <h2>Imagine You're Standing in Egypt</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're standing in Egypt right now, looking at the challenges the country faces every day. Now, what would happen if Egypt were to launch an attack on Israel? It's not about who's stronger in a fight, but about the devastating impact it would have on every single Egyptian.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide" id="slide2">
  <h2>Risks and Consequences of War</h2>
  
  <h3>Significant Military Power, Yet High Cost of War</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> While Egypt possesses a large and powerful military, a direct confrontation with Israel's qualitatively advanced forces would be incredibly costly, leading to an unsustainable resource drain and a protracted conflict.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Egypt has one of the largest militaries in the Middle East and Africa (e.g., substantial manpower, tanks, aircraft), yet Israel holds an edge in advanced technology, F-35s, and missile defense.</p>
  
  <h3>Economic Catastrophe</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> War would devastate Egypt's vital tourism and Suez Canal revenues, cause hyperinflation, massive debt, and critically disrupt supply chains. Egypt's economy is already fragile.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> UNDP estimates billions in losses, current tourism decline due to regional tensions, and Egypt's existing high debt.</p>
  
  <h3>Severe Humanitarian Crisis (Food, Water, Disease)</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> Conflict would lead to widespread food and water scarcity due to disrupted supply chains and distribution. Mass displacement and overwhelmed public services would create conditions ripe for outbreaks of disease, leading to immense suffering.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Experience from current regional conflicts shows massive displacement and aid strain; Egypt's already strained resources for public health and water infrastructure.</p>
  
  <h3>Domestic Instability</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> A failed or costly war would trigger widespread public unrest and severely undermine the government's legitimacy.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Polling shows Egyptians prioritize economic stability and believe conflict cannot be resolved militarily.</p>
  
  <h3>International Isolation</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> Violates the long-standing peace treaty, leading to loss of crucial international aid, partnerships, and diplomatic standing as a mediator.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, Egypt's reliance on foreign aid.</p>
  
  <h3>Our Own Home in Chaos</h3>
  <p><strong>Reason:</strong> If a war brought immense suffering and economic ruin, it would lead to frustration and hardship boiling over, causing unrest and instability right here at home.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Polling shows Egyptians prioritize economic stability and believe conflict cannot be resolved militarily; people would lose faith.</p>

  <h2>Counter Claim</h2>

  <div class="counter-point">
    <img src="counter1.jpg" alt="Counter to National Defense and Deterrence" />
    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>Counter to “National Defense and Deterrence”</h3>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Launching an attack in the name of deterrence could escalate into a wider war, endangering millions of civilians and undermining regional security. True deterrence is better achieved through strategic defense, diplomacy, and international pressure—not preemptive war.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="counter-point">
    <img src="counter2.jpg" alt="Counter to Support for Palestinian Rights" />
    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>Counter to “Support for Palestinian Rights”</h3>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Military aggression in the name of supporting Palestinian rights could backfire, causing further suffering for Palestinians and drawing international condemnation. Constructive support comes through diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and advocating for peaceful solutions—not through war.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="counter-point">
    <img src="counter3.jpg" alt="Counter to Regional Leadership Assertion" />
    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>Counter to “Regional Leadership Assertion”</h3>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Attempting to gain regional leadership through violence delegitimizes Egypt’s standing in the international community. Leadership is best achieved through diplomacy, economic development, and soft power—not military aggression, which could isolate Egypt and damage its economy.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="counter-point">
    <img src="counter4.jpg" alt="Counter to Violation of Agreements or Borders" />
    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>Counter to “Violation of Agreements or Borders”</h3>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Even if violations occur, international law—specifically the United Nations Charter—requires peaceful dispute resolution unless under immediate armed attack. Any response must be proportionate and sanctioned through appropriate international channels, not unilateral war.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="counter-point">
    <img src="counter5.jpg" alt="Counter to Response to Aggression" />
    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>Counter to “Response to Aggression”</h3>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> If Israel initiates aggression, Egypt is entitled to defend itself—but such defense must be measured, targeted, and preferably multilateral. Escalating to full-scale war could worsen the situation for both nations and invite greater regional or global conflict.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="counter-point">

    <div class="counter-content">
      <h3>What Happens If Egypt Attacks Israel?</h3>
      <p>If Egypt attacks Israel, initially Egypt might gain ground. However, Israel would call support from allies including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India, France, Hungary, Czech Republic, Brazil, and Azerbaijan. This support would likely turn the tide against Egypt, resulting in a devastating loss.</p>
      <p>This would be a calamity for Egypt and other Arab countries, as Egypt is a regional power among its allies. A defeat would enable Israel and its allies to become the strongest regional force, causing massive loss of life and potentially realizing Israel's ambitions as a dominant power.</p>
